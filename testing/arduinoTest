We tested the arduino and found out that the errors 
come out to be of the order of about .3 cms in the 
process of measurement of distances with the ultrasonic
sensor.

input - output - acceptable

3.0 cm - 2.3 cm - N
6.0 cm - 5.7 cm - Y
7.0 cm - 7.1 cm - Y
10.0 cm - 10.2 cm - Y
15.0 cm - 14.8 cm - Y
25.0 cm - 25.0 cm - Y
30.0 cm - 29.8 cm - Y
40.0 cm - 39.8 cm - Y
50.0 cm - 50.3 cm - Y
60.0 cm - 60.7 cm - N
80.0 cm - 80.3 cm - Y
100.0 cm - 100.4 cm -N 

In the tested range, our device seems works with acceptable 
outputs.
